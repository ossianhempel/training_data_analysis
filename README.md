# Personal Workout Data Analysis üèãÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

## Introduction

Welcome to my personal workout data analysis project. If you've ever been curious about how workouts evolve over time or what kind of insights you can get from your sweat sessions, you're in the right place. I've been using the RepCount app since 2016 to keep tabs on my workouts, and now it's time to put that data to work.

## Objectives

1. **Skill Building**: One of the main goals here is to improve my data analysis skills. What better data to work with than my own workout stats, right?
   
2. **Insights**: Besides skill-building, I'm aiming to uncover some useful or at least interesting insights about my workout habits.

### Research Questions

1. Which months am I most active in the gym?
2. What muscle groups do I focus on the most?
3. Is there an upward trend in the weights I'm lifting?
4. Are there muscle groups that I'm neglecting?

## Dataset

- **Time Range**: February 2016 to November 2022
- **Rows**: 26,622
- **Features**: 12

## Tech Stack

- Python
- Pandas
- Numpy
- Matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebook

## Key Findings

1. **Seasonal Trends**: Training intensity peaks in February/March and July, closely aligned with massing and cutting phases.
   
2. **Muscle Focus**: Delts and back are leading the pack in terms of training frequency. Hamstrings and calves? Not so much.
   
3. **Weight Trends**: Mixed results here. Some exercises show a progressive overload, but the overall trend is a bit flat.
   
4. **Balance**: Some muscle groups get more love than others. Good to know for future planning.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repo
2. Install the required packages
