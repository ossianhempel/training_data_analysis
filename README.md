# Workout Data Analysis - RepCount
## Description
This project aims to analyze personal workout data that has been tracked through the RepCount app since 2016. The data is explored and analyzed using Python, specifically Pandas, Numpy, and Seaborn/Matplotlib libraries for data manipulation and visualization.

The primary goal of this project is to practice and improve data analysis and data presentation skills. As a bonus, we also aim to uncover interesting patterns and insights related to the workout history.

## Research Questions
During the course of this project, we seek to answer the following research questions:

1. Which months do I train the hardest?
2. Which target muscles do I train most frequently?
3. Am I lifting more weight over time?
4. Do I have any imbalances regarding body parts in my workouts?

## Datasets
The dataset used in this project is derived from the RepCount app, which has been used by the author since 2016 to track workouts. The data includes detailed records of each workout session, including the date, exercise performed, weight used, repetitions performed, and any additional notes.

## Methodology
The data analysis is performed using Jupyter Notebooks, with Python as the primary language. The analysis involves exploratory data analysis, visualization, and interpretation of results. The project makes extensive use of the Pandas library for data manipulation, the Numpy library for numerical operations, and the Seaborn/Matplotlib libraries for data visualization.
